Class component
- Need to use react component instead
- Called smart or stateful components
- has state and lifecycle methods
- Can use refs to reference elements

Functional components
- basic JS functions (regular or arrow functions)
- refered as dumb or stateless components
- cannot use lifecycle methods(like componentDidMount)
- Doesnt have its own refs
- No render method used in functional components
- Mainly responsible for UI, tipically presentational only(Like an input component)
- Can accept and use props
- Mostly used if you dont need state management
- can use react hooks

Props
- input/parameters that component can accept
- makes your component reusable
- should be treated as an inmutable object inside the component

Style Attributes
- accepts a camel cased JS object
- react will automatically append a px suffix to crtain numeric inlines
- most often used in react applications to add dinamically computed styles at render time

Class creation
- pass a string as the className prop
- mos className depends on props/state to dinamically render the UI
- generally better performance than inline styles

Typescript props
- To use typescript for props we can use "interface"
- Interface defines the schema of what properties an object can toHaveTextContent
- to define an optional property just add a suffix "?'
